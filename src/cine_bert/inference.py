I can't lie I still got a few laughs out of the movie, but they removed some of the more iconic moments and some of the changes made no sense. It felt rushed but also dragged on a lot longer than the original, they rushed the iconic scenes and dragged out the new scenes, the new neighbor character is supposed to be the responsibile adult in lilo and nanis life but ends up being the direct reason lilo gets taken by child services. David was barely in the movie and doesn't really feel like a love interest for nani he comes off as an awkward guy the first time we see him."
